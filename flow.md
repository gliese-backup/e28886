- jab user first time site pe aata hai toh usko hm `homepage.ejs` dikhate hein jisme register form hota (if the user is not logged in, we get this info from the cookie)
- if the cookie is present then we show them the `dashboard.ejs` which lists the user's recently published research papers
- `login.ejs` allows to login to an already exisiting account
- if the user is logged in, we show them `create-paper.ejs` to publish new papers
- when you publish a new research paper, we show them `single-paper.ejs`
- this `single-paper.ejs` shows a button to edit or delete if you are the author
- whenever you click on edit, we show them `edit-paper.ejs` with values pre-filled
- whenever you click on logout from the header we delete the cookie and then redirect back to the homepage
- whenever you create a new account, (taking only username and password) we hash the password before storing it in the database and then send a cookie back to the client with userid and username
- when we login, we compare the incoming password with the one stored in the db, if correct we send back a cookie
